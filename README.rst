Scrubuntu
=========

Scrubuntu is an ansible playbook for cleaning out the cruft from a standard ubuntu installation, leaving
something bare bones.

Stuff like apache and a mailserver - you don't really want this installed by default. This cleans it out.

It also updates and upgrades everything and fixes some locale issues that I sometimes have.

Feel free to fork and add to the list of stuff to remove if you think I missed something.
